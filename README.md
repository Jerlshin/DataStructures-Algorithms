## 🎯 Specialization Courses

The specialization consists of **six courses (modules)**, each concentrating on a distinct sphere of algorithmic design and analysis.

---

### 1. **Algorithmic Toolbox**

An introductory course that emphasizes core principles of designing and analyzing algorithms, with a strong focus on efficiency and optimization paradigms.

- **Algorithms** – Algorithm design principles and complexity analysis *(Big-O notation)*  
- **Greedy Algorithms** – Locally optimal decisions to achieve (or approximate) global optimality  
- **Divide and Conquer** – Solving problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems and merging solutions  
- **Dynamic Programming** – Solving complex optimization problems via subproblem reuse and memoization  

---

### 2. **Data Structures**

This course explores foundational structural components crucial for efficient software engineering.

- **Basic DSA** – Arrays, linked lists, and core data structure implementations  
- **Hash Tables** – Collisions, chaining, and open addressing for fast lookups  
- **Priority Queues & Disjoint Sets** – Heaps (min/max) and union-find structures for connectivity tasks  
- **Binary Search Trees** – Organization, traversal, and balancing concepts  

---

### 3. **Algorithms on Graphs**

Graphs model social networks, maps, infrastructure networks, and more. This module focuses on their traversal, search, and structural analysis.

- **Decomposition of Graphs** – DFS and BFS for exploring graph components  
- **Paths in Graphs** – Identifying paths, cycles, and computing topological order  
- **Shortest Paths** – Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms  
- **Minimum Spanning Trees** – Prim and Kruskal algorithms  

---

### 4. **Algorithms on Strings**

This module covers advanced text-processing algorithms essential to bioinformatics and search.

- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** – Optimized pattern-matching algorithm  
- **Suffix Trees** – Data structure enabling rapid pattern identification  
- **Suffix Arrays & Burrows-Wheeler Transform** – Compression and string search strategies  
- **Efficient Construction Techniques** for suffix trees/arrays  

---

### 5. **Advanced Algorithms and Complexity**

The theoretical culmination of the specialization, tackling optimization and intractability.

- **Linear Programming** – Optimization with linear constraints  
- **Flows in Networks** – Maximum flow/minimum cut (Edmonds-Karp, Dinic)  
- **NP-complete Problems** – P vs NP, computational hardness  
- **Coping with NP-completeness** – Heuristics, approximations, and strategies  
- **Streaming Algorithms** – Sequential processing with limited memory  

---

### 6. **Genome Assembly Programming Challenge**

A practical bioinformatics application leveraging all previously learned algorithmic principles.

- **Genome Assembly via de Bruijn Graphs** – Reconstructing DNA from sequencing fragments  
- **Handling Real Sequencing Data** – Error management and noise correction  
- **Case Study: 2011 European E. coli Outbreak** – Real-world application of computational biology
